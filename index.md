## Motivation
In the last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a revolutionary
approach in a vast amount of tasks, including cancer detection, financial market
forecasting, autonomous driving, and mastering complex table games such as Go.

However, each task, that an AI agent needs to undertake requires an appropriate formulation and parameter
tuning. Considering, for example, a convolutional neural network for cancer
detection, it is not possible to extend it in any way to render it able to achieve any
other task, such as playing chess. Although AI techniques are able to solve each of the
two cases, one cannot deal with the problem of the other.

Each method can solve a specific sets of tasks and requires a meticulous
parameter tuning for every experiment to be completed. An approach able to
overcome these limitations would be greatly useful for two reasons. The first and
most straightforward one is that it would permit to reduce the duplication of effort
required in task and experiment-specific tuning. In this regard, the economic benefit
in the long term is clear. The second is a more subtle, but not less relevant, one; a
technique with such a high complexity can have emerging properties due to the
interaction of its different components.
An example of a system that is able to accomplish multiple, different kinds of
tasks, is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This could theoretically accomplish any
job that a human being could perform. It would be the solution to the specificity
problem that afflicts machine learning at the present time, achieving similar results,
if not even better.

An AGI can be obtained by many means, but one of them it to take inspiration from Human Intelligence.
On one hand this has the advantage of being a solid and tested solution, and on the other it is the only one of its kind that is known so far. For these reasons the cooperation between the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, and Psychology is fundamental to follow this path.
