## What is it?
Project developed for the Computational Creativity course of the University of Helsinki. 
It consists of an AI that receives a couple of words as input, 
which uses to download images related to such concepts and merge them meaningfully. 
The AI learns how to produce art for public enjoyment by using feedback it receives 
from displaying its art on a website created on purpose.

## What did I do?
- Led the team, providing motivation and suggestions on the direction to take 
- Developed Javascript web frontend for the public to judge the art the AI produced 
  with a thin Flask backend to collect feedback
- Developed one Python/Tensorflow AI for criticising art and another for generating it
