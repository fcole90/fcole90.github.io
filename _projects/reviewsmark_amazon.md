## What is it?
Webapp (and CLI) which allows to summarize Amazon reviews of a product into a short list 
of pros and cons. It uses simple NLP and sentiment analysis algorithms to determine
the most relevant results.

## What did I do?
- Led the team, suggesting roles and directions, based on the skills they reported and the impression I got of each of them during the planning phase
- Developed language analysis and optimisation using Python and NLP libraries
