## What is it?
HandSketch is a prototype of application intended as an experiment of Human-Computer interaction.
The idea behind it is to develop a set of toolbars for a raster drawing application which rely only
 on gestural interaction to switch drawing instruments and their settings, allowing the mouse cursor
  to not leave the canvas during drawing. The gestural input is provided through a Leap Motion sensor.

The program provides very basic drawing instruments on a raster canvas.
 It has a side toolbar whose widgets provide the selection of the active drawing tool, 
 the color and the tool options. Each widget is activated and controlled through a proper rotation gesture,
  and the numeric value of the settings is controlled with a circle gesture.

## What did I do?
 - Contributed to the main idea
 - Developed many drawing tools in Javascript and HTML
 - User Interface and User Experience design and analysis including User stories and user study evaluation

## Awards
[This application was selected as one of the best of the year 2016 and to be preserved in the
HCI professor personal archive as reference for following classes.](https://people.unica.it/davidespano/teaching/ium/archivio-progetti/)
