I created this new presentation website, as the old one was getting old and was a bit ugly.
I also wanted to create something fresh and new, to put to test my UI and
web development skills. So, I'm today publishing the first stable version
of my new website!

## Jekyll
I previously decided to use React and Gatsby, but the process was too
cumbersome for such a small project (Node modules) and the few free time 
I had (I'm still writing my master thesis), so I decided to
simplify everything and use Jekyll, which I know better and is simpler
to use.

## Next steps
In the future plan to add a *Resource* page, where to collect important or
 interesting material which can be useful to my readers. The topics can be
 anything among programming, machine learning, HCI and natural languages.
 
 Other additions I have in mind are a gallery with a selection of my most
 decent pictures, a selection by keyword/tag and some general improvement to
 make the look more uniform and pleasant.
 
 *See you soon!*
