# Who am I?
I am a very curious person by nature, and I like to learn, discover and create and fix things; 
and I developed my passion for Computer Science exactly to second such attitudes of mine. 
I like working in teams, and Iâ€™m ready to take the lead when needed as well as relinquish the role when appropriate. 
I have good programming skills, especially in Python, but I love to learn new programming languages, 
frameworks, and technologies. I have a high determination and motivation to succeed and achieve high quality results.
 Strong resiliency. I strive to make the world a better place for everyone.

## What are my skills?
### Python and data science
Highly proficient in Python, using and creating modules; 
libraries like numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, tensorflow.

### Web development
Experience with Flask, Django and Javascript. I can use most web technologies 
(HTML, CSS, JSON, requests, ES5 modules, node, webpack and babel, Jekyll).  

### Linux ecosystem
Good understanding of Linux and snap apps, I am a long time Ubuntu user, to which 
I actively contribute by reporting and triaging bugs. 

### Other programming languages
To a lesser degree I can read and write Java, C and C++, 
including using C++ vector operations and OpenMP multithreading. 

### Spoken languages
I can speak Italian (mother tongue), English (C1), 
elementary Swedish (currently actively learning), and Finnish.
